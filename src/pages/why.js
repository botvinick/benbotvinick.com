          I've made certain decisions in the past two months that have completely altered the course of my life.{' '}
          <span className="text-gray-400 underline">[<a href="#f1n">1</a>]</span>
          <br /><br />

          Before I begin to explain, I'd like to acknowledge my motivations here. By nature, I'm not a very public
          person. I actually much prefer that nobody around me has any kind of window into my life, except for my
          closest friends. To that end, I've kept very quiet over the past few months, and have, at some points, been
          deliberately misleading when people have asked me why I dropped three classes and completely withdrew myself
          socially. There came a point when I realized that my current life situation is so tightly coupled with my
          identity that it's become difficult to avoid an explanation in casual conversations. So my motivations here
          are simple: 1. to avoid the tedious explanation of my life situation that has become so unavoidable, 2. to get
          ahead of any rumors you hyenas have been cooking up, and 3. to give you a better idea of why I act the way I
          do. If this essay comes across as even a little bit self-indulgent, please text me, and we can hash it out,
          because that's the last thing I want. My number is (215) 880-4458.<br /><br />

          To understand why I dropped my classes, you first have to understand why I switched schools after freshman
          year. Although being sick of GFS after ten years of meeting for worship (the Quaker practice of gathering as a
          community for an extended period of silent reflection) had something to do with it, my transfer to Milton was
          much more heavily motivated by reckless adventurism. As someone who's counted the days until high school
          graduation since middle school, I was convinced that living in a dorm would be the perfect way of attaining
          the independence I longed for. <span className="text-gray-400 underline">[<a href="#f2n">2</a>]</span> During
          my first two years at Milton, I pursued every opportunity, made every connection, and took every risk I
          possibly could have taken. Acting again out of an immense desire to transcend high school, I became a
          freelance web developer, held positions at various companies, cofounded two shitty startups (both of which
          inevitably failed after a few months of pickledicking around), and eventually settled into a full-time
          position at a company I won't name here for reasons I won't get into. The value of these experiences was
          unparalleled, and as I entered college season &mdash; or as one of my friends describes it, "The
          Jungle" &mdash; in the spring of 2020, I was sure that I had done everything I possibly could have done in
          high school to set myself up for a happy life, and the time to move on had finally arrived.<br /><br />

          Then along came COVID. In the interest of brevity, I will pretend here as if the pandemic's only effect was to
          bestow upon me an abundance of free time, the likes of which I had never experienced
          before. <span className="text-gray-400 underline">[<a href="#f3n">3</a>]</span> I filled this void in a number
          of ways, including reconnecting with old friends by spending an inordinate amount of time watching repugnant
          films (e.g. <i>The Kissing Booth</i>) and then critiquing them for hours on
          end. <span className="text-gray-400 underline">[<a href="#f4n">4</a>]</span> During the day, I began working
          on a side project building payment infrastructure for online communities. We called
          it <a href="https://metalabs.io">Meta Labs</a>.<br /><br />

          My goal for the summer was not to found a startup. My goal for the summer was not to deal with lawyers, hire
          employees, and write code for twelve hours a day, every day. My goal for the summer was not to facilitate half
          a million dollars in consumer transactions in eighteen different countries for five hundred small businesses.
          None of these things were on my summer 2020 bucket list. But they all happened, and by August I was in way
          over my head.<br /><br />

          In late September, after working over twelve hours a day for six months, I was offered some money to
          pursue the project full-time. <span className="text-gray-400 underline">[<a href="#f5n">5</a>]</span> In hopes
          of preserving whatever privacy I have left, I will not state the precise amount I was offered, nor by whom (if
          these details are important to you, feel free to text me, my number is listed in the second
          paragraph).<br /><br />

          Although I never meant or expected to end up doing what I'm doing, I'm happier than a pig in shit. I get to
          work with the smartest people in the world building a product for customers I love to death, and I get to do
          it on my terms. I wake up in the morning and feel like the captain of a ship I built. But taking money from an
          investor raises the stakes significantly. If I fail, I have to clean up the mess, and if I throw in the towel,
          I sacrifice any hope of raising money from another respectable investor in the future. If I've learned
          anything since March, it's that Hollywood lied. Running a startup is by far the hardest thing I've ever had to
          do, and the 99% chance of failure goes to show just how insane I am to be doing it at all.<br /><br />

          The day after graduation, I'm flying out to California and I'm not coming back until I fail. The catch, and
          the reason I'm writing this essay in the first place, is that failure is not the worst-case scenario in my
          mind. In reality, my nightmare is waking up five years from now and realizing that nobody in my life has any
          idea who I am. This essay is step one in my five-year plan to prevent that from happening.<br /><br />

          If even one of you read to this point and knows any more about me than you did before, then this was a
          success. Again, my number is (215) 880-4458. Don't be a stranger.

          <div>
            [<a name="f1n">1</a>] This essay was originally intended as a letter to my classmates to explain why I
            wasn't showing up to class. I never actually published it though, and it ended up being more of a promise
            to myself than anything else.
          </div>

          <div>
            [<a name="f2n">2</a>] It's worth acknowledging at this point that I couldn't be more grateful to my parents
            that these were parameters I was able to optimize for to begin with.
          </div>

          <div>
            [<a name="f3n">3</a>] Again, worth mentioning that I'm fully aware of my privilege here.
          </div>

          <div>
            [<a name="f4n">4</a>] If you take offense at my use of <i>The Kissing Booth</i> as an example of a repugnant
            film, we should talk. I'm very interested in hearing any argument on its behalf.
          </div>

          <div>
            [<a name="f5n">5</a>] For those of you who have no idea what this means, investors offered me money like on
            Shark Tank except I wasn't on TV.
